    "## \"Designing data\" is the act of modelling things that occur in real life\n",
    "\n",
    "I find the act of designing data to be one of the most interesting and creative parts of programming. If your data is designed well, then writing the functions can become much easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "When designing data, look for opportunities to \"capture\" the qualities of the real-life phenomenon you are trying to represent and put those same qualities in your data design. For example, we captured the phenomenon that information about an artwork does not change in the design of our `ArtWork` datatype by using `NamedTuple` instead of `dataclass`. By using `NamedTuple` we also have access to the quality that an artwork is unique, because `NamedTuple` is _hashable_.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you can also model too much. It is important to balance the amount of thoughtful modelling you put into your datatype with the actual functionality that you need to get out of your datatype: e.g. if I really wanted to capture the qualities of an artwork, should my `ArtWork` datatype also capture the medium? Maybe it should also store a URL to an image of the artwork! That would be cool.\n",
    "\n",
    "But hold on: does your application _need_ to have this much data captured right now? If you don't actually need this information yet, then do not capture it. If in the future you do, then it is easy to add this to your application _because_ you have taken the time to thoughtfully create a datatype."
