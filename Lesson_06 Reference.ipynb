    "\n",
    "A `list` allows us to store any kind of data and access data by its position in the list via indexing. A list allows us to _append_, _insert_, and _remove_ values from it. In other words, it is _mutable_ because we can mutate it, change it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `tuple` is just like a list in that it is an array of data and we can access data by its position in the tuple via indexing. HOWEVER, we cannot _append_, _insert_, or _remove_ values from the tuple after it is created. In other words, it is _immutable_. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why on earth would anyone use a `tuple` when they can use a `list`?** \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason to use a `tuple` instead of a list is because `tuples` are _hashable_. This means that, because they do not change, they can be assigned a \"permanent\" location in computer memory and used as a look-up value for other data. _See `dict`, below_.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to make a `tuple`\n",
    "\n",
    "Use parentheses (instead of square brackets) to make a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [\"cat\", 123, \"bat\", 45.3]\n",
    "my_tuple = (\"cat\", 123, \"bat\", 45.3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Because tuples are immutable, there are not really any methods attached to them. There are only two:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `.count(item)` Returns the number of times that `item` occurs in the tuple\n",
    "* `.index(item)` Returns the index of the item in the tuple\n",

    "### Iterating\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "A `list` can have multiple copies of the same data. So can a `tuple`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `set` can only have one copy of any given item.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [\"cat\", \"bat\", \"bat\", \"hat\"]\n",

    "The `my_set` above, when evaluated, will only contain `{\"cat\", \"bat\", \"hat\"}` even though two `\"bat\"` was added to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to make `set`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to make a `set`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# First way, use braces {} (but without colons, just each item separated by commas)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterating over `set`\n",
    "\n",
    "Since `set`s are unordered, they cannot be iterated over. If you want to iterate over the information contained within a `set`, then you must convert it to a `list` which you can iterate over.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "set_to_list = list(my_set)\n",
    "for item in set_to_list:\n",
    "    print(item)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: there is no way of know what order the items in your list will be. To guarantee an order, use `sorted()`:\n",
    "\n",

    "set_to_list = sorted(list(my_set))\n",
    "for item in set_to_list:\n",
    "    print(item)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Special properties of sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with sets can make your life easy, especially for certain tasks. \n",

    "## `dict`: Dictionaries (key: value pairs)\n",
    "\n",
    "A `dict` is a unique kind of type in Python and it is said that Python itself is _built_ around dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `dict` is a collection or array, like `list` and `tuple`, except instead of storing single values separated by commas, it stores two values separated by commas, a _key_ and a _value_.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_loads = {\"DL\": 20, \"LL\": 50, \"SL\": 30, \"WL\": 20}\n",
    "\n",
    "wood_moduli = {\"D. Fir\": 19200, \"SPF No. 1\": 16300, \"SPF No. 2\": 16300, \"Hem/Fir\": 17600}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are similar to sets: dictionary keys are unique just as items in a set are unique. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How to make a `dict`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# First way, using braces {}\n",
    "my_dict = {\"item 1\": 53, \"item 2\": \"cat\", \"item 3\": [23, 53]}\n",
    "\n",

    "                                                       \n",
    "# Yet Another way, using a list of tuple pairs\n",
    "my_dict = dict([(\"item 1\", 53), (\"item_2\", \"cat\"), (\"item 3\", [23, 53])])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionary keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary keys have to be _hashable_. In other words, they need to be one of the _immutable_ data types, e.g. \n",
    "\n",
    "* `bool`\n",
    "* `int`\n",
    "* `float`\n",
    "* `str`\n",
    "* `tuple`\n",

    "\n",
    "A `list` _cannot_ be a dictionary key. It is mutable.\n",
    "A `dict` _cannot_ be a dictionary key. It is also mutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary keys must be able to be allocated into \"permanent\" memory storage so that Python can always go back to check their equality against an incoming key look-up. If they can change, they are no longer reliable items to look up against.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "Like lists and tuples, you can access the data in a dictionary with indexing. Except, with lists and tuples, you use the integer position of the item in the list. With dictionaries, you use the _key_ as your index.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_loads[\"DL\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "wood_moduli[\"SPF No. 2\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods (also, see _Iterating_ below)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`.update(item)`** Change the keys: values in the dictionary with the keys: values in `item` (which itself must be a dictionary) (Remember this one)\n",
    "* **`.get(key, [fallback])`** Attempt to get the value for `key` from the dictionary. If `key` is not in the dictionary, return the `fallback` value. (Remember this one, too)\n",
    "* [Others (see this outside documentation)](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_dictionary.asp)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterating\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways of iterating over dictionaries and all three use special methods:\n",
    "1. By keys\n",
    "2. By values\n",
    "3. By both keys and values (\"items\")\n",
