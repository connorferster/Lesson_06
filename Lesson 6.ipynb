    "A really important aspect of program design is designing the right \"data type\" for your data. Depending on the data types you select for your program, your program can either become much easier to write or much more difficult to write.\n",

    "There are many different kinds of data types available to us in Python. The most basic and most useful ones are the \"built-ins\". There are many more other ones at your fingertips as part of the Python standard library (which comes pre-installed with Python). There are still EVEN MORE data types available in many 3rd party data manipulation libraries (which are pre-installed as part of the \"Anaconda\" Python distribution).\n",

    "## A Word about \"Duck Typing\"\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the features of Python is that it uses what is called, \"duck typing\". The idea is that if, \"it sounds like a duck, walks like a duck, and looks like a duck, then it must be a duck\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other programming languages such as C, C++, C#, Visual Basic, Java, etc. Python does not require us to _declare_ the data type of our variable at the time that we assign a value to it. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = \"cat\"\n",
    "b = [23, 54.3, 42]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "VB:\n",
    "```C#\n",
    "Dim a As String\n",
    "a = \"cat\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Dim b As Array\n",
    "b = [23, 54.3, 42]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea with Python is that something can be, say, \"list-like\" and work just like a list even if it is not actually a list. This makes the language very flexible and fun to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def example_func(list_like_data):  # This will work with lists, tuples, strings, dicts, sets (and more) because they are all iterable.\n",
    "    acc = []\n",
    "    for item in list_like_data:\n",
    "        acc.append(item)\n",
    "    return acc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarily, when we write a function, we do not _need_ to declare the types of our function arguments. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_func(name, age):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Returns a string greeting someone by their 'name' and 'age'.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    return f\"Hi, {name.capitalize()}! I hear you are {age} years old.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "**vs.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_func(name: str, age: int) -> str:\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Returns a string greeting someone by their 'name' and 'age'.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    return f\"Hi, {name.capitalized()}! I hear you are {age} years old.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These Python type \"declarations\" are what we call \"type annotations\". They do not affect the code in anyway. They are, as far as the machine is concerned, completely useless. When type annotations are included in Python code, they are just passed over much like comments are.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only reason to include type annotations in Python are for people (like, yourself) who may be reading your code in the future and trying to figure out what is going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "I always use type annotations in my functions and I find them to be very useful. However, I do not use them on _every variable_. There is a balance that can be struck.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we talk about creating data definitions, we will be using some type annotations. I recommend going through the process that I am showing you and getting into the habit of describing your data with data definitions and type annotations."

Useful when representing groups of data that are not expected to change, e.g. x, y, z coordinates. Because tuples are immutable, they can be _hashed_ - a powerful technique that allows tuples to be used as keys in `dicts` and can also be put into `set`s.\n",
    "* `dict`: A collection type to represent _mappings_, when you need to correlate one piece of information with another, e.g. name and age, or file names and file contents, or beam names and beam lengths. As of Python 3.6, dictionaries also maintain the order of items that have been added to it (a sometimes useful feature). Dictionary keys must be _hashable_ (immutable).\n",
    "* `set`: An _unordered_ collection to represent _unique items_ in a collection. Useful when working with groups of data that are somehow mutually exclusive and when you might need to quickly _compare_ the members of two or more groups. e.g. collections of `(x, y, z)` coordinates (what are the coordinates that are in \"group A\" but not in \"group B\"?)"

It is important to balance the amount of thoughtful modelling you put into your datatype with the actual functionality that you need to get out of your datatype: e.g. if I really wanted to capture the qualities of an artwork, should my `ArtWork` datatype also capture the medium? Maybe it should also store a URL to an image of the artwork! That would be cool.\n",
